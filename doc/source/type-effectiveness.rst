Double Type Mechanics
=============================================
Unlike Pokemon, in order to provide a more consistent and balanced experience, every battler in MonsterBattles has exactly two types.
There are a total of 8 types, and each type is weak/strong against exactly 2 other types. (2 Tentative types that don't follow this rule, the balance behind these types would be no battler of this type would get the advantage of a double type.)
For the effectiveness of dual-typed battlers, all strengths and weaknesses are combined additively.

For example, a grass-ice type battler:
Grass is weak to Fire & Flying
Ice is weak to Fire & Water
So, a grass-ice type is weak (2X damage) to Flying & Water
And helpless (4X damage) to Fire
The same mechanic applies to resistances as well (damage taken from a move a battler is strong too)
In the case of a grass-ice battler,
Grass is strong against Water & Electric
Ice is strong against Dark & Flying
So a grass-ice type is strong against:
Water, Electric, Dark and Flying

The tradeoffs of dual typing is very clear, then, extra type coverage at the expense of a strong type weakness in most cases.
