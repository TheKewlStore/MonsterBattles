Similar to Pokemon (though more consistent), every battler in MonsterBattles has exactly two types.
There are a total of 9 types, and each type is weak/strong against exactly 2 other types.
For the effectiveness of dual-typed battlers, all strengths and weaknesses are combined additively.

Example: A battler with a dual grass and ice type:

Grass is weak to Fire & Flying

Ice is weak to Fire & Water

So, a grass-ice type is weak (2X damage) to Flying & Water

and is super weak (4X damage) to Fire

The same mechanic applies to resistances as well (damage taken from a move a battler is strong too)

In the case of a grass-ice battler,

Grass is strong against Water & Electric

Ice is strong against Dark & Flying

So a grass-ice type is strong against:

Water, Electric, Dark and Flying

The 9 monster types are as follows:
### Fire
    Strong Against: Grass & Ice
    Weak Against: Water & Dark
### Water
    Strong Against: Fire & Ice
    Weak Against: Grass & Electric
### Grass
