# MonsterBattles

## Overview
MonsterBattles is a game based loosely off of turn-based strategy games like Pokemon.
The biggest emphasis of MonsterBattles is creating a balanced, competitive game with as little RNG as possible,
while also keeping the core gameplay mechanics as simple as possible.

## Monster Types
Similar to Pokemon (though more consistent), every battler in MonsterBattles has exactly two types.
There are a total of 9 types, and each type is weak/strong against exactly 2 other types.
